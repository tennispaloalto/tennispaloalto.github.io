Tennis Palo Alto is all about having fun while playing tennis.  The founder (Mark) "vanished" into a wormhole in 1984 and reemerged in 2014 to find tennis was a lot
more fun and a lot more rewarding than it was thirty years earlier.  Now the SuperSonicFox <http://supersonicfox.com/> wants everyone in or near Palo Alto to experience that same
incredible sensation of being on a welcoming, competitive (sort-of), and supportive tennis court.

See <http://www.meetup.com/tennispaloalto/> to join our group and start to have great (friendly) tennis matches... with others who will enjoy playing with you.

See <http://tennistownandcountry.com/> for your equipment and apparel needs.

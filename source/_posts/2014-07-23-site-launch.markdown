Tennis Palo Alto is now launched!!!!!!!!

Tennis Palo Alto is all about having fun while playing tennis.  The founder "vanished" into a wormhole in 1984 and reemerged in 2014 to find tennis was a lot
more fun and a lot more rewarding than it was thirty years earlier.  Now the SuperSonicFox wants everyone in or near Palo Alto to experience that same
incredible sensation of being on a welcoming, competitive (sort-of), and supportive tennis court.
